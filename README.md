# _Streaming_ MongoBURS

Streaming Mongo backup and restore for AWS and GCP.

[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/utilitywarehouse/streaming-mongo-burs/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/utilitywarehouse/streaming-mongo-burs)

## About
This is a simple tool to backup and restore mongo collections from S3. Data is streamed through a configurable compression algorithm directly to S3 without using ephemeral storage on a node, with the exception of a legacyRestore operation, which will copy data to ephemeral storage for compatibility.

This work is based on the original `mongo-burs` script however differs significantly from it, as backups are now BSON blobs from `mongodump`; this is what allows streaming. 

### Backup
Run the container in your environment (typically on a cron) with the configured environment variables

### Restore
Run the container with the following arguments `restore $TIMESTAMP $COLLECTIONS`. If you are restoring backups made prior to mongo-burs v1.4.0 use `legacyRestore` instead of _restore_; this is due to previous versions creating an archive of a mongo dump directory, rather than compressing an archive binary blob. Both commands take the same `$TIMESTAMP` and `$COLLECTIONS` args.

|Argument|Format|Description|
|--------|------|-----------|
|TIMESTAMP|YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS (2019-01-01T12:42:04)|the date to restore the database from|
|COLLECTIONS|Database.Collection,... (test.test,test.test2)|the collections you wish to restore into the database as a CSV string|


### Environment Variables

|ENV|Description|Required|
|---|-----------|--------|
|MONGO|a mongo connection string|[x]|
|BUCKET|the name of the bucket you want to backup the database to|[x]|
|AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID|the aws key ID|[x] (AWS only)|
|AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY|the aws secret key|[x] (AWS only)|
|AWS_REGION|the aws region|[x] (AWS only)|
|GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH|location of the service account JSON file|[x] GCP only|
|COMPRESSION|compression algorithm to use, default `gzip`, other options are `xz` and `zstd`||
|VOLUME_MOUNT|optional path to mounted PVC to use as temporary storage||

***Note***
in addition to the `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH` env var you will need to mount the credentials file into the container
